# Pypipes

This is a simple piping library which offers a novel syntax of writing pipes:

```python
>>> from pypipes import p
>>> [1, 2, 3] |p> sum
6
```

See? No parentheses! I've written more documentation in the actual code itself; take a look at that if
you wish.

Install it using `pip install pipes-python` (because the title pypipes is already taken up).
